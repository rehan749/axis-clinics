              <h1 class="fw-bold">History</h1>
          <p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px;">Idea of Axis clinic was seeded in the year 2010 with an aim of changing the conventional way of treating pain related to spine, joints and sports injuries by creating a parallel health care system which targets on prevention and restoration of natural integrity of the body dynamics. The current way of treatment where the emphasis is on removing the entire part of the diseased structure through surgery, we encourage to heal the tissue through most advanced targeted minimally invasive techniques and preserving the normal tissue thereby restoring the functions. But due to lack of a team with like-minded specialists, it was not possible till recently. Over the last decade we have worked hard to find and build a team of like-minded professionals who are actually masters in their field and not only understand but firmly believe in the concept of preservation and healing of what we are gifted with naturally. This has led to realization of Axis Clinics as one of the finest and best Centers in Delhi addressing pain related to spine, joints and sports injuries.</span></p>
